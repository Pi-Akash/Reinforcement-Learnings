1. <a href = "https://github.com/Pi-Akash/Reinforcement-Learnings/tree/main/snake-pygame">Snake game using AI</a><br>
<p style="text-align:justify">I learned to implement this snake game using AI with the help of fantastic playlist on the same from <b>Patrick Loeber</b>. You can find the whole playlist <a href = "https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2UrDh7vUmJ60YrmWd64mTTKV">here</a>. I have added comments wherever I feel was needed, also I will try to come up with a flowchart or literature of how things work in the snake game.</p>
